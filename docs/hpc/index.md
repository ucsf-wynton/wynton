**NEWS**: (_For upcoming and current incidents, see the [Status](/hpc/status/index.html) page_)

2023-09-28: [Rocky 8](/hpc/software/rocky-8-linux.html): 5% of Wynton compute slots are now running on Rocky 8 compute nodes. 33 compute nodes with a total of 880 CPU slots run Rocky 8.

2023-09-13: [Rocky 8](/hpc/software/rocky-8-linux.html): Development node `dev3` is now running Rocky 8.

2023-07-21: [Rocky 8](/hpc/software/rocky-8-linux.html): Wynton will migrate from CentOS 7 to Rocky 8 at the end of October 2023. To prepare for this, we have made one non-PHI and one PHI development node available for all users, together with six compute nodes.

# {{ site.cluster.name }} - UCSF Research Computing at Scale

{{ site.cluster.name }} is a large, shared high-performance compute (HPC) cluster underlying UCSF's Research Computing Capability. Funded and administered cooperatively by UCSF campus IT and key research groups, it is available to all UCSF researchers, and consists of different profiles suited to various biomedical and health science computing needs.  Researchers can participate using the "co-op" model of resource contribution and sharing.

**The {{ site.cluster.name }} environment is available for _free_ to all UCSF researchers**.  To join, please follow the [instructions for requesting an account](/hpc/about/join.html).

The {{ site.cluster.name }} environment keeps growing as more users discover it and more groups buy into the co-op model.  [Each contributing member brings more resources and compute power for everyone based on a fair-share model where contributors get higher access priority than non-contributing members](/hpc/about/shares.html).  **Contributions to the {{ site.cluster.name }} environment are non-expiring and valid for life!**  In addition, several UCSF centers have joined by contributing a large amount of their compute hardware to the cluster, e.g. Memory and Aging Center and QB3.  For more details on where we are heading, please see the [{{ site.cluster.name }} Roadmap](/hpc/about/roadmap.html).

**Please note**: The {{ site.cluster.name }} environment is _not_ certified for use with Protected Health Information (PHI) _unless you have a Wynton PHI account_.  Data containing PHI must not be transferred to, mounted on, or processed with any {{ site.cluster.name }} cluster resources other than in the Wynton PHI environment.  For more information or to apply for a PHI account, see [Protected Health Information (PHI) on Wynton].
