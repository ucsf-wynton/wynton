### October 14-18, 2024

#### <span style="color: orange;">Full downtime</span>

**Notice**: The cluster will be shut down for maintenance from 8:00 am
on Monday October 14 until 5:00 pm on Friday October 18, 2024. This is
a full downtime, including no access to login, development,
data-transfer, and app nodes. Compute nodes will be shutdown as
well. Starting 14 days before, the maximum job runtime will be
decreased on a daily basis from the current 14 days down to one day so
that jobs finish in time before the shutdown. Jobs with runtimes that
go into the maintenance window will be started after the downtime.
The reason for the downtime is that UCSF Facilities will perform
maintenance affecting cooling in our data center. We will take this
opportunity to perform system updates and BeeGFS maintenance.
