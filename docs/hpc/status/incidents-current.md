### October 23-October 27, 2023

**Update**: Development node `dev2` is available again.

**Notice**: Access to login node `log2`, data-transfer nodes `dt1`,
and development node `dev2` will be disabled from Monday-Friday
October 23-27, 2023 (2023W43) to upgrade the operating system to Rocky
8 Linux.  They might return sooner.  The alternative login node
`log1`, data-transfer nodes `dt2`, and development nodes `dev1` and
`dev3` are unaffected, so are the Wynton HPC Globus endpoints.
