# CentOS Core Software

A large number of common Linux software tools are available on the
cluster as part of the core setup.  Below follows a small excerpt of
what tools are available development nodes and compute nodes. The
login and data-transfer nodes have a much smaller selection of
software.

_Note:_ These core tools will be updated without notice as the
operating system is updated on a regular basis via the CentOS package
manager [yum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yum_(.rpm)).  Many of the
tools originate from the (stable) CentOS 7 [Extras] and [EPEL]
repositories.  To see what software and system libraries that are
installed, run `yum list installed`.  Please note that, compared to
compute nodes, the development nodes have additional software
installed (typically named `-devel`) needed to build and compile from
source.
