# Support Channels

To better assist with your issue:

  * Include your username on the cluster
  
  * What machine are you trying to use, e.g. login or development node?
  
  * On emails, please use 'Reply All' in all your correspondence
  
  * [Don't include screenshot images](/hpc/support/faq.html#avoid-screenshots-when-asking-for-help); instead, cut-and-paste text from the console
  
  * If you have problems with jobs (e.g. not running or given errors), make sure to include the job IDs of the job you need help on
  
  * Never include PHI or other sensitive data in unencrypted emails or Slack channels. If you need to include sensitive data, use the UCSF encrypted email system (invoke by including "Secure:" at the start of the email subject line.) Do not include sensitive data in your Slack posts
