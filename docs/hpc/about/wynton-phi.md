# Protected Health Information (PHI) Compliance

Wynton PHI environment, which is subset of the Wynton HPC environment, is approved for storing and working with Protected Health Information (PHI) data as long as the specific PHI-data usage is covered by the institutional review board (IRB) approval for the principal investigator (PI). This way, PIs can be confident that they are conducting their research computing with PHI in a compliant environment.

## Getting a Wynton PHI account

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert" style="margin-top: 3ex; margin-bottom: 3ex;" markdown="1">
2021-12-17: Contrary to Wynton HPC, we can currently onboard only UCSF staff and UCSF affiliates who have a UCSF ID on Wynton PHI. We are working on allowing also non-UCSF research collaborators to get a Wynton PHI account with approval from the PHI project's PI.

To apply for a new Wynton HPC account with PHI access, or to update an existing account for PHI access, please follow the [instructions for requesting or updating an account](/hpc/about/join.html). This will initiate an automated onboarding process to check that you meet the following prerequisites:

* Valid email address

* PI approval to work on Wynton PHI

* Attested to UCSF Statement of Responsibility

Once these are completed, you will be notified of your account credentials to access Wynton PHI. If you already have a regular Wynton HPC account, your account will be reconfigured to access Wynton PHI.


## Other options at UCSF to work with PHI data

Depending on your project, Wynton PHI may or may not be the best fit for your project. We encourage you to also evaluate the following alternatives at UCSF that are approved for PHI data:

* [UCSF Research Analysis Environment (RAE)](https://it.ucsf.edu/service/rae)
* [UCSF Data Center Services](https://it.ucsf.edu/service/data-center-services)
* [UCSF Central IT Cloud Services](https://cloudservices.ucsf.edu/)
