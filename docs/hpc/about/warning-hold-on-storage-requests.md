**2025-01-15: Temporary Hold on Storage and Compute Requests**

As Wynton continues to expand, we are approaching the limits of space,
cooling, and power capacity in the Byers Hall server room. In
addition, as we work to move the administration of the cluster to the
Academic Research Systems (ARS) Team, we are currently reprioritizing
our workload with the support of Wynton faculty leadership to ensure
that we continue to meet our most critical objectives. We understand
that this may cause some delays and appreciate your patience and
understanding during this period.<br>

* _Waitlist for New Storage Brick_: If you are already on the waitlist
  for the new storage brick, please be assured that you will be
  notified when this service is brought online.

* _Pending Requests_: If you have recently submitted a request and have
  not yet received a response, we will evaluate whether we can
  accommodate some or all of your requests at this time. The Wynton
  Project Manager will reach out to you with more information.

* _Urgent Needs_: If you have an urgent need, please contact [{{
  site.cluster.email_support }}](mailto:{{ site.cluster.email_support
  }}) with the details of your request and its urgency. We will do our
  best to accommodate your needs.
