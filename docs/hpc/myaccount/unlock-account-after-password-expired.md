# Your Account Was Locked Because Password Expired

## What happened and why?

If you are reading this, **your Wynton account was locked, because you
let the password expire**. _Passwords must be updated at least every
12 months_ per University of California requirements. Wynton sends out
automatic email notifications reminding any user that their password
is about to expire. These email messages are sent each Sundays
starting two weeks before a password expires (*).

To avoid this from happening again, please make sure update your
password at least every 12 months. If you cannot remember when you
last changed it, you can always [change your
password](../howto/change-pwd.html) at any time.


## Instructions for unlocking your account

The _only_ way to unlock your account at this point is via
ServiceNow. Do not send an email to Wynton support - they can only
unlock your account if you have created a ServiceNow ticket.

Instructions:

1. Go to the [Wynton Account Request/Wynton Account Modification]
   ServiceNow form

2. Under 'Account Details', choose **'Yes'** for _"Does this user
   already have an existing account on Wynton?"_

3. Fill out the remaining required fields

4. Submit the form

The Wynton Support Team will get notified and take action on it on a
daily basis.


_Footnotes_:

(*) If you did not receive such a message, please let support know, so
that we can investigate. The messages are titled '[Wynton] Your Wynton
password is expiring' and are sent from `support@wynton.ucsf.edu` to
the email address that is associated with your Wynton account.
