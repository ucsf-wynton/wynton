# Job Summary

The more accurately you can specify the required resources (memory, running time, local scratch needs, ...) of your jobs, the better the job scheduler can serve your needs and often your jobs will be processed sooner.  For instance, if you have a good sense of the amount of memory and run time your job needs, then you can specify these via [SGE resource options]({{ '/scheduler/submit-jobs.html' | relative_url }}) `mem_free` and `h_rt`.  If you don't specify them, your job will use the default settings.

If you don't know how much resources your job consumes, you can add `qstat -j $JOB_ID` to the end of your job script.  This will output a summary of your job to the job output log.  Here is an example of a job that runs R, draws 100 million random numbers and calculates their summary statistics. We also call the garbage collector 1,000 times to emulate some CPU processing to give the scheduler enough time to snapshot the job.  At the end, we output the job summary.

```sh
#!/bin/env bash
#$ -cwd    ## use current working directory
#$ -j yes  ## merge stdout and stderr

## Summarize 100 million random numbers in R, which occupies
## 100e6 * 8 bytes = 0.80 GB of RAM.
## We also run the garbage collector 1,000 times to
## emulate some CPU processing time
Rscript -e "x <- rnorm(100e6); for (i in 1:1e3) gc(); summary(x)"

## End-of-job summary, if running as a job
[[ -n "$JOB_ID" ]] && qstat -j "$JOB_ID"
```

As a first guess, we can assume that this script takes at most 5 minutes to run, but let's assume we don't have a good sense on how much memory it will consume, so we submit it as:

```sh
$ qsub -l h_rt=00:05:00 job_summary.sge
Your job 2854740 ("job_summary.sge") has been submitted
```

When the job completes, we can find the resources as part of the output file:

```sh
$ grep "usage" job_summary.sge.o2854740
usage         1:            cpu=00:00:14, mem=6.82412 GB s, io=0.00903 GB, vmem=810.203M, maxvmem=810.203M
```
The full details are available at the end.

With this information, we can narrow down that the total processing time was 14 seconds (`cpu=00:00:14`) and that the maximum amount of virtual memory used was ~810 MB (`maxvmem=810.203M`).  With the help of `cpu` and `maxvmem` from previous runs, we can re-submit this job script with more relevant resource specifications;

```sh
$ qsub -l h_rt=00:01:00 -l mem=1G job_summary.sge
```


_Comment_: Note that the `mem` value has unit `GB s` (GB * seconds), which is because it is the "accumulated memory usage of the job in Gbytes seconds".
